This repository contains replication code for the paper *Men’s and women’s productivity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a cross-country comparison of software developers*.

The code is divided into two parts:

1. `collection` contains mainly Python code used for data collection
2. `analysis` contains R code used for data analysis

Each folder contains dedicated README files with more detailed explanations.

Please note that the raw data is not available in this repository due to data privacy concerns. Aggregated data as used in the analysis is available in the `analysis/aggregdata` folder.
